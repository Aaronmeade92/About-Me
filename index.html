        <p> I love to cook, workout and eat. My first job ever was working at a babecue joint and I loved it. The stress, the hustle, the people and the free food! It was all great.

        <p> I have worked in many different fields while trying to navigate my way through my early life. None of them offered me much more than just experience, I enjoyed them while I could but none of them were long lasting. </p>
