    <h1>Welcome to Aaron's About Me Page!</h1>
    <h2>Short Bio!</h2>
          <ul>
        <li><h3>Hobbies</h3></li>
        <p> I love to cook, workout and eat. My first job ever was working at a babecue joint and I loved it. The stress, the hustle, the people and the free food! It was all great. I workout about five times a week and try to eat as healthy as possible. I'm not too strict about my diet because I do like to have fun every once in awhile and over indulge on things I probably shouldn't.

      <ul>
        <li><h3>Codefellows</h3></li>
        <p> I graduated high school in 2012, after that I tried community college which really didn't workout. I always struggled in traditional school, I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to learn about things I didn't have any interest in. My goal for this class, and all other classes I take at CodeFellows, is to really take as much knowledge and wisdom from all the TAs, instructors and all of my classmates as I can.

          <li><h4>Food</h4></li>
        </ul>
         <p>I have worked in many different fields while trying to navigate my way through my early life.
           None of them offered me much more than just experience, I enjoyed them while I could but none of them were long lasting.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Football</h4></li>
        </ul>
        <p> I am very passionate about the sport of football. It has always been a huge part of my life and I can honestly say that I would not be anywhere near as mature or mentally tough without football. It means so much more to me than just a game. After my playing career finished I immediately jumped into coaching at the high school level. That is where my true passion lies, coaching and teaching young boys into young men is such a rewarding and exciting experiece.
