    <p>Short Bio!</p>

        <li>Hobbies!</li>
        <p> I love to cook, workout and eat. My first job ever was working at a babecue joint and I loved it. The stress, the hustle, the people and the free food! It was all great. I workout about five times a week and try to eat as healthy as possible. I'm not too strict about my diet because I do like to have fun every once in awhile and over indulge on things I probably shouldn't.

        <p> I have worked in many different fields while trying to navigate my way through my early life. None of them offered me much more than just experience, I enjoyed them while I could but none of them were long lasting. </p>
        <p> I am very passionate about the sport of football. It has always been a huge part of my life and I can honestly say that I would not be anywhere near as mature or mentally tough without football. It means so much more to me than just a game. After my playing career finished I immediately jumped into coaching at the high school level. That is where my true passion lies, coaching and teaching young boys into young men is such a rewarding and exciting experiece.
